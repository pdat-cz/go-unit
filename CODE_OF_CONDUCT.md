# The Introvert-Friendly Code of Conduct

## Our Simple Promise

We promise to make this project a nice place for everyone. Yes, even for you who'd rather debug code than make small
talk at parties.

We believe good code comes from happy coders, regardless of who they are or how they identify. We're all just trying to
make cool stuff without the drama.

## Be Cool (It's Not That Hard)

Things that make our community awesome:

* Being kind (you know, basic human stuff)
* Respecting different opinions (even if they use tabs instead of spaces)
* Giving helpful feedback (not "this sucks" but "have you considered...")
* Owning up to mistakes (we all make them, even that one dev who thinks they don't)
* Thinking about the community (we're all in this repository together)

Things that are not cool:

* Being mean or creepy
* Making personal attacks (attack the code, not the coder)
* Harassing people (nobody wants this, seriously)
* Sharing private info without permission (that's just not cool)
* Acting in ways that would make others uncomfortable (when in doubt, don't)

## When Things Go Wrong

Our maintainers will step in if needed. They're not looking to be the code police, but they will help keep things
running smoothly.

If someone's not being cool, maintainers might:

1. Send them a friendly message (everyone has bad days)
2. Ask them to take a break if needed
3. Remove problematic content
4. In rare cases, ask someone to leave the community

## Need Help?

If you experience problems, contact the project maintainers by opening an issue on GitHub (https://github.com/pdat-cz/go-measurement/issues).

We'll handle issues privately and fairly. No public shaming, no drama.

## Remember

Be kind, be respectful, write good code. That's pretty much it.
